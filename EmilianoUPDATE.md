## Work Block — 2026-09-07

Completed: Set up the Gridium research workflow and established the division between research planning/interpretation and repository implementation. Validated the IdealGridium Python/QuTiP environment and grounded the working notes in the Gridium paper and Thomas's guidance. Audited the existing `Rabi_3Photon` implementation and identified that the intended three-photon control mechanism, pathway, tone structure, and drive operator still needed to be pinned down before making substantive changes.

Next: Clarify the intended three-photon control scheme with Thomas, then turn those answers into the first bounded and reproducible control-validation task.

### Questions for Thomas

- Is the intended three-photon logical gate driven through flux modulation rather than charge modulation?
- Should the control machinery support three independently tunable drive frequencies from the beginning?
- Is there a preferred intermediate-state pathway that should be treated as the initial reference implementation?


## Work Block — 2026-09-08

Completed: Characterized the candidate three-photon pathways and the protected-point selection rules of the symmetric IdealGridium model. Identified important degeneracies and showed that several superficially similar interpretations of the control scheme lead to materially different implementations and matrix elements. This made it clear that the control physics should be resolved before optimizing a gate numerically.

Next: Use Thomas's clarification of the physical drive, pathway, and symmetry-breaking intent to define the first validated three-tone control experiment.

### Questions for Thomas

- Which physical flux coordinate/operator is intended to drive the logical gate?
- Is the first three-tone pathway intended to connect the logical states through the 0/5/4/1 manifold, or should a different intermediate manifold be used?
- Should perfect symmetry be treated only as a reference point, with slight fabrication asymmetry introduced intentionally for control?


## Work Block — 2026-09-15

Completed: Built and validated the three-tone flux-drive control workflow in symmetric IdealGridium and obtained a converged X180 candidate with 98.67% logical fidelity, 0.47% final leakage, approximately 0.50% peak leakage, and a 21.5 ns gate time. Tightened the time-domain solver enough to separate numerical error from coherent gate error and found that the remaining infidelity is primarily coherent axis/angle error rather than leakage. The result established a reliable symmetric baseline for testing X90 control and eventual symmetry breaking.

Next: Use the validated symmetric X180 as the control baseline, construct an X90 gate with the same methodology, and then determine how slight symmetry breaking affects fidelity, matrix elements, and leakage before moving to the full four-mode model.

### Questions for Thomas

- Can you confirm that `0 <-> 5`, `5 <-> 4`, `4 <-> 1` is the intended first three-flux-tone pathway?
- For the first symmetry-breaking study, which physical asymmetry should we vary first, and is there a preferred nominal magnitude or fabrication-relevant range?


## Work Block — 2026-09-16

Completed: Calibrated and validated a symmetric IdealGridium X90 candidate with 99.23% logical fidelity, 0.061% final leakage, and 0.198% peak leakage, and added robust eigenstate tracking for near-degenerate manifolds. Tested a simple external-flux offset as a symmetry-breaking proxy and found that it rotates/mixes the logical doublet rather than cleanly representing the fabrication asymmetry we want to study. Implemented and diagnosed the symmetric three-mode S23 model, finding that its fully extended representation has a common-coordinate/topology problem rather than a simple cutoff problem, then merged the validated work into `four-mode-asym-gridium-tests` as requested. Audited the shared four-mode code and identified `qchard_gridium_netlist.Gridium4Mode` as the authoritative candidate model; the initial bounded validation suite gave 13 passed and 5 intentionally skipped production-scale checks, while `N4=6 -> 8` was already stable and Stage-1 retained-state convergence remained the main numerical issue.

Next: Validate Stage-1 retention in the netlist-derived four-mode model before attempting spatial-basis convergence or porting the X90/X180 control workflow. Keep four-mode gate optimization on hold until the physical flux-drive operator is established.

### Questions for Thomas

- For the physical flux drive, is the intended control line primarily modulation of `phi_ext`, `theta_ext`, or a calibrated linear combination of the two?
- Can we treat `qchard_gridium_netlist.Gridium4Mode` as the intended physical four-mode asymmetric model going forward?
- Is there an author-approved resolution of the factor-of-two discrepancy in the inductive term between Eqs. S23 and S26?


## Work Block — 2026-09-17

Completed: Continued validation of `Gridium4Mode` and isolated the Stage-1 shift-invert eigensolver as the dominant numerical bottleneck rather than Hamiltonian construction. Instrumentation showed that sparse LU factorization and fill-in dominated runtime; the default COLAMD ordering produced about 73.1x fill, while `MMD_AT_PLUS_A` reduced this to about 47.8x and substantially reduced memory and inverse-solve cost. Verified that the new ordering preserves the same Hamiltonian physics: at `k=100`, Stage-1 eigenvalues agreed to approximately `5.3e-13 GHz`, downstream energies agreed within approximately `0.000441 MHz`, and eigenpair/orthogonality residuals remained near numerical precision. A bounded `k=120` study still showed retained-space convergence failures, and a successful `k=140` solve was checkpointed for later state-overlap, operator, and cutoff-boundary analysis rather than rerunning expensive calculations.

Next: Resume only from the saved `k=140` artifacts, determine whether the retained-state error is ordinary slow Rayleigh-Ritz convergence or a more structured coupling problem, and use that evidence to decide whether a bounded `k=160` extension is scientifically justified.

- Can we treat `qchard_gridium_netlist.Gridium4Mode` as the intended physical four-mode asymmetric model going forward?
- Is there an author-approved resolution of the factor-of-two discrepancy in the inductive term between Eqs. S23 and S26?


## Work Block — 2026-09-18

Completed: Extended the four-mode retained-state study through `k=180` and found that energy-ranked Stage-1 truncation can miss physically important higher-energy states: the `170 -> 180` step shifted `f06` by about 57.53 MHz even though the logical doublets remained well tracked. Post-processing traced the effect primarily to a small cluster around Stage-1 states 172/174/175, including a strong fourth-mode-assisted near resonance involving state 172, and showed that the dominant shell coupling is carried mainly through the `x2/x3` sector. A separate local Gridium sandbox then tested blind residual-, coupling-, channel-, QoI-, and operator-response enrichment methods using only the saved `k=180` parent data; the best blind constructions matched or beat the diagnostic hand basis spectrally at the same retained dimension, reaching about 2.81 MHz maximum first-six transition error and 0.363 MHz `f06` error, while operator-response/Krylov enrichment improved `d_theta` from roughly 20.6 MHz/rad for ordinary energy truncation to about 4.3 MHz/rad but still did not match the hand basis. Also productionized the validated optional `MMD_AT_PLUS_A` solver path and expanded the bounded physical-validation suite to 21 passed and 5 intentionally skipped tests covering flux periodicity, finite-cutoff charge-periodicity behavior, Hermiticity, and state-resolved `d_phi`/`d_theta` periodicity, with no physical inconsistency found.

Next: Stop brute-force energy-only `k > 180` growth and treat retained-subspace construction as the remaining numerical problem, especially blind representation of `d_theta` response. Once that issue is sufficiently controlled, resume `n1max/N2/N3` spatial-basis convergence and independent operator/model validation, then port the validated three-tone X90/X180 workflow to the asymmetric four-mode model.

### Questions for Thomas

- Is there an author-approved resolution of the factor-of-two discrepancy in the inductive term between Eqs. S23 and S26?


## Work Block — 2026-09-25–2026-09-26

Completed: Incorporated Thomas's clarification that the current abstract four-mode control coordinate is `Gridium4Mode.grid_phi()`, with `phi_grid = theta3 + theta2/2`; `d_theta()` and `d_phi()` are external-flux response/sensitivity operators rather than the default microwave-drive proxy, so poor `d_theta` convergence is not a blocker for current gate work. Reproduced the frozen one-mode gates without reoptimization. X90 has duration `39.8007574 ns`, gate fidelity `0.9923100794`, process fidelity `0.9884651191`, final leakage `0.061239%`, and peak leakage `0.197513%`. X180 has duration `21.4963121 ns`, gate fidelity `0.9866983593`, process fidelity `0.9800475389`, final leakage `0.471441%`, and peak leakage `0.498001%`. Added permanent state-population, leakage, drive-trace, intermediate-population, convergence, and compiled CSV artifacts for these frozen validations; convergence plots now use gate infidelity `1-F_gate` rather than misleading offset notation.

Thomas Response:

- What do you mean by frozen one-mode gates?

Generalized the multitone workflow so `IdealGridium` uses `phi()` and `Gridium4Mode` uses `grid_phi()`, with every tone coupled through the same full operator and the existing per-target matrix-element normalization preserved. A reduced-basis four-mode three-tone smoke test demonstrated working `grid_phi` propagation; this was strictly a control-plumbing diagnostic, not a gate claim and not convergence evidence.

Independent review caught two serious problems in the initial retained-basis analysis: a symmetric Sep-18 k180 checkpoint had accidentally been reused as an asymmetric N=51 reference, and noncontiguous shell-state overlap embedding was incorrect. The affected numerical conclusions were withdrawn before finalizing the science. State tracking was corrected so noncontiguous retained coordinates are embedded at their actual Stage-1 ranks and overlap assignments consistently reorder eigenvectors, energies, transitions, tensors, and `grid_phi`; regression tests cover both noncontiguous embedding and reordered states.

Generated a fresh asymmetric N=51 k180 reference with `EJ=5`, `EC=0.5`, `EL=1`, `ELK=1`, `EJS=4`, `ECS=8`, `eC=5.5`, `eP=10`, `eps_J=0.10`, `eps_LK=0.05`, `ng=0`, `phi_ext=0`, `theta_ext=pi`, `n1max=4`, `N2=N3=51`, `L2=11`, `L3=14`, `N4=8`, Stage-1 `k=180`, `sigma=-24`, `which=LM`, `tol=1e-8`, and `MMD_AT_PLUS_A`. Its Stage-1 dimension is `23,409`, matrix nnz is `599,625`, LU nnz is `28,667,572`, fill ratio is `47.809x`, factorization time is `66.346 s`, ARPACK time is `170.118 s`, and the solve used `736` inverse solves. The maximum eigenpair residual is `5.433e-12`, median residual is `8.512e-13`, and orthogonality residual is `3.247e-12`. This is now the trustworthy asymmetric N=51 oracle.

Thomas Response:

- Just so we are on the same page, can you create a full explaination of what each variable here corresponds to in the model?

The inherited symmetric shell-informed k170 basis failed for the asymmetric model, with about `109.9 MHz` maximum transition error, about `13.22%` error on the important `7->8` `grid_phi` edge, and material leakage-coupling errors. An asymmetry-specific shell audit identified Stage-1 state 170 as the dominant omitted contribution: removing it caused about `105.369 MHz` transition error and up to `0.144713` absolute primary-path matrix-element error. The selected asymmetric basis is `0..159 + {162,163,165,167,168,170,171,172,176,177}`. Against full asymmetric k180 at N=51, it gives `3.055 MHz` maximum transition error, `0.999938` minimum tracked overlap, `0.005236` absolute / `0.452%` maximum primary-path `grid_phi` error, and `0.009153` absolute / `2.13%` maximum audited logical/leakage `grid_phi` error. The leading pathway remains `0 -> 7 -> 8 -> 1`, with full-k180 primary edges `0->7 = 1.911695`, `7->8 = 1.157822`, and `8->1 = 1.815039`. This k170 basis is controlled enough for the next spatial-convergence calculation at N=71; it does not establish spatial convergence and does not make the system ready for X90/X180 optimization.

---

Thomas Response:

- Why are we now looking at the 0->7->8->1 transition path? This is the first I am hearing of this. I am sure the cross parity manifold coupling is larger, but generally speaking it is harder to trust that these higher energy states are valid given various spurious capacitances in the physical circuit that are not captured by the model, let alone convergence issues that may arise in the existing model. Where can I find the convergence tests for states 7 and 8 in these models?

---

Solver/resource work confirmed `MMD_AT_PLUS_A` as the best tested SuperLU ordering. A local N=71 k180 solve was not practical on the current machine, and N=101 was rejected by resource preflight. Created and independently reviewed a portable external N=71 runner with explicit `--dry-run`/`--execute` modes, frozen physical/numerical settings, cryptographic pinning of the verified N=51 oracle, atomic incomplete/complete checkpoints, output hashing and checkpoint authentication, same-solve k170/k172/k175 analysis, overlap-based N=51-to-N=71 tracking, near-degenerate-subspace tracking, assignment-confidence diagnostics, SVD/principal-angle diagnostics, basis-invariant `grid_phi` subspace metrics, and `resolved`/`ambiguous`/`deferred` pathway claim gating. The runner is `READY FOR EXTERNAL N=71`. The durable scientific checkpoints are `956869f` (`Clarify Gridium control semantics and add gate validation artifacts`) and `f9fdd829d780d9d88f9919af4f2b3891e5bc5782` (`Validate asymmetric four-mode grid_phi workflow`); both are on `upstream/four-mode-asym-gridium-tests`.

Next: Run the frozen asymmetric N=71 k180 reference on a higher-memory machine using the reviewed runner, compare N=51 to N=71 with overlap/subspace tracking, and validate the asymmetry-specific retained basis there. Do not begin four-mode X90/X180 optimization until spatial convergence is understood.

---

Thomas Response:

- Why are you choosing specifically N=71 and N=51? Moreover, can we just treat one very long k run (let's say k on the order of 200+) as the ground truth, save the diagonalized system up to whichever levels nicely converge at that point, and avoid all the quibbling over specific cuttoffs?

---

### Questions for Thomas

- Does the asymmetry-specific k170 basis with full k180 as the reference look reasonable for the N=71 spatial-convergence check?
- Is there a preferred higher-memory machine or cluster for the N=71 run?

---

Thomas Response:

1. Where can I find these outputs?
2. Yes. I can run simulations on machines which have up to ~1Tb of RAM if need be. This is through Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's Lawrencium cluster.

## Work Block — 2026-09-27

Completed: Successfully validated the asymmetric four-mode `N=71, k=180` reference. N=51→N=71 state tracking remained clean, and the dominant `grid_phi` pathway stayed `0 -> 7 -> 8 -> 1`. The old raw-index k170 basis failed because important shell states moved in rank, but a common physics-informed k172 basis works well at both N=51 and N=71. The first bounded four-mode X90 test showed that the intended pathway is activated, but the inherited pulse is not a viable gate: the full three-tone pulse gave `F_gate≈0.366` with \~28% leakage trapped in states 7 and 8, while the middle tone alone produced substantial logical rotation with negligible leakage. The main problem is now pulse-area, phase, and interference control rather than spatial convergence.

Next: Build a driven four-state `{0,1,7,8}` model, compare it with the full propagation, run tone ablations, and determine how the direct logical drive interferes with the mediated pathway before any broad optimization.

### Questions for Thomas

- Does the common physics-informed k172 basis look reasonable for the next control studies?
- Should we continue treating the three-tone mediated pathway as primary, or intentionally exploit the direct logical coupling from the middle tone?

---

Thomas Response:

1. Sorry, where can I find this?
2. Let's keep down this pathway for a short while longer. Can you explain what changed between your early reporting of extremeley high fidelity gates and your reporting now of poor fidelity?

Other questions:

- What do you mean in some figures by "smoke traces"
- Are you using this k=180 and N=51 simulation for referencing errors in energy levels in the histogram plots? Are you doing that because of something I said, or is there good reason to believe things have converged by that cutoff?
- Why does the x90_state_populations.png graph look so much worse than the x180_state_populations.png graph? Moreover, for the reported fidelity, can you take it to be the peak fidelity rather than the final fidelity? We can and should always cutoff our simulation at whichever time point reports the highest fidelity, which in this case, appears to be sooner than the last time step.

---

## Work Block — 2026-09-28

Completed: I went back through the four-mode results specifically around the concerns you raised. A few of our previous statements were too strong. In particular, `k=180` should be treated as our current reference endpoint rather than an oracle/ground truth, and the `N=51 -> 71` comparison shows that states 7 and 8 are encouragingly stable but does not yet establish full spatial convergence or robustness to omitted circuit parasitics. The `0 -> 7 -> 8 -> 1` pathway was not chosen beforehand for a physical reason; it emerged as the strongest three-step pathway under the four-mode `grid_phi` matrix-element ranking. The earlier `0 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1` pathway belonged to the symmetric one-mode `IdealGridium` model, and I should have made that model/pathway transition explicit before using the new route.

I also audited the earlier gate results. The ~99.23% X90 and ~98.67% X180 results were optimized and validated in the symmetric one-mode model. The recent ~36.6% X90 result was an unoptimized pulse transplant into the asymmetric four-mode model, so it should be interpreted only as a diagnostic that the one-mode pulse does not directly transfer. I also reran the frozen one-mode trajectories while retaining the full propagator as a function of time. The original X90 trajectory reaches `F_gate = 0.999967` at `32.2405 ns`, and X180 reaches `F_gate = 0.999987` at `16.2472 ns`, substantially before their nominal endpoints. These are not yet validated shorter gates because simply changing `T_gate` would rescale the cosine envelope; they need a defined truncation/envelope convention and revalidation before replacing the existing durations.

The tracked `Figures/Rabi_3Photon/README.md` now serves as an output manifest, including which results are on GitHub and which raw checkpoints are still local-only. I also replaced the ambiguous “smoke trace” interpretation in our working terminology: those calculations are diagnostic propagations/control-plumbing tests, not validated gates.

### Responses to your questions

- **What do the model variables mean?** 

- `EJ`, `EC`, `EL`, `ELK`, `EJS`, and `ECS` are the Josephson, charging, and inductive energies of the KITE/S branches; `eC` and `eP` parameterize the cross-KITE and fourth-node parasitic capacitances in energy form; `eps_J` and `eps_LK` are fractional branch asymmetries; `ng`, `phi_ext`, and `theta_ext` are bias coordinates. `n1max`, `N2`, `N3`, `L2`, `L3`, and `N4` are basis/grid cutoffs, while `k`, `sigma`, `which`, `tol`, and `MMD_AT_PLUS_A` are eigensolver/truncation parameters. I can expand any of these further if useful.

- **Why `0 -> 7 -> 8 -> 1`?** 

In the asymmetric four-mode model we ranked all three-step paths by the product of the three `grid_phi` matrix elements. `0 -> 7 -> 8 -> 1` was the numerical winner by a large margin at both N=51 and N=71. That establishes it as a strong candidate within the present model, not yet as the physically safest path.

- **Where is the convergence evidence for states 7 and 8?** 

The retained-basis tests show strong convergence toward the current k=180 parent, and the N=51 -> 71 spatial comparison gives state overlaps of about `0.99959` and `0.99907`. Their transition frequencies still shift by about `3.84 MHz` and `6.20 MHz`, respectively, so I would not yet call them fully spatially converged.

- **Why N=51 and N=71?** 

They were practical finite-difference resolutions, with N=71 chosen as the next affordable refinement. They were not selected as part of a formal multi-point extrapolation sequence.

- **Why k=180?** 

We had used k=180 as the largest available same-model reference and compared smaller retained spaces against it. That does not prove k=180 itself is converged. Your suggestion of a larger k>200 parent is the cleaner test, and I agree that should be the next large calculation.

- **Where are the outputs?** 

The tracked output inventory is now in `Figures/Rabi_3Photon/README.md`. The one-mode validation and derived diagnostics are visible there. The raw N51/N71 eigensystem checkpoints are still local/ignored because of their size; the manifest now explicitly marks that distinction.

- **What did “smoke traces” mean?** T

hey were control-plumbing / diagnostic propagations used to verify that the projected operator, normalization, solver, and pulse wiring were working. I agree the term is unclear and will not use it for research-facing results.

- **Why does X90 look worse than X180?** 

The X90 pulse is longer and passes through a near-complete swap before rotating back toward the intended X90 operation, which makes its population trajectory look more oscillatory. It actually has lower leakage than X180.

- **Peak versus final fidelity:** 

I agree that the useful gate endpoint should be chosen around the fidelity maximum rather than automatically taking the end of an oversized trajectory. The frozen trajectories reach `0.999967` (X90) and `0.999987` (X180) substantially before their nominal endpoints. I am treating those as candidate endpoints for now rather than validated new gate durations, because the pulse-envelope convention has to be defined and revalidated.

Next: Finish and run a larger asymmetric N=71 `k>200` reference on Lawrencium, with same-parent comparisons at `k=180`, `200`, and the larger endpoint. The direct quantities I plan to compare are `f07`, `f08`, state-7/8 overlaps, the three `grid_phi` matrix elements along `0 -> 7 -> 8 -> 1`, and the pathway ranking. Only after that would I return to four-mode gate optimization.
